<big>CachyOS 23.02</big>

We've just released the second update of 2023! This release primarily focuses on fixing some issues with the rate-mirrors backend, which is used to rate the mirrors before the netinstallation.
In addition, we're excited to introduce the cachyos-community-v3 repo to both the netinstall and offline installations. This repo has been tested for a month now and everything is working great.
Most of the packages have been recompiled for better performance.

We've also added three new desktop environments - Budgie, Mate, and LXDE - to the online installation. We're still testing hyperland, but it's not ready to be included as a default just yet.

- The cachyos-community-v3 repo has been added
- Budgie, Mate, and LXDE desktop environments have been added to the Netinstallation
