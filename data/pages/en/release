<big>CachyOS 23.05</big>

This is our fifth release in 2023.
We got our "Git Migration" done and this release does reflect the latest changes in the repository layout.
The repository "cachyos-v3" contains now only CachyOS packages like kernels and custom optimized packages (python, gcc, glibc, ...).
The recompiled packages are now in the "cachyos-core-v3" and "cachyos-extra-v3" repositorys.
The "Qtile" Desktop enviroment got also several fixes and changes. Thanks to @Array
Calamars got some minimal fixes and @NextWorks did update our calamares slide to reflect the changes in the provided desktop enviroments.
As always there were also major package upgrades like linux-cachyos 6.3, python 3.11, cachy-browser 113.0.2 and mesa 23.1.1.
In the next month we will start to migrate to a new server and will work on providing a full x86-64-v4 rebuild.
Also for the next release it is planned to rework the netinstallation to make it easier to install a "clean" without CachyOS related packages.
