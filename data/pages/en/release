<big>CachyOS 23.11</big>

This is our 11th release in 2023.
The release does bring some changes related to the nvidia module. We will stop using nvidia-dkms and will use precompiled modules.
Equal as we do with the zfs module.
This will improve the update times, when installing the kernel. We are providing the nvidia module for **all** of our kernel.
Also we added the nvidia module for linux-zen and linux-hardened, to have the arch kernels also covered.

The new "Cachybuilder" is running very well now and we are happy that we have finally more control over the packages. Also packages are getting now faster updated.
The x86-64-v4 support is still planned for this year and we will start adding this ISA to the builder soon.

Here's a summary of the changes:

<big>Features:</big>

- nvidia: Use nvidia module instead of dkms
- Calamares synced with upstream
- Package updates: linux-cachyos 6.6.1, nvidia-utils 545.29.02, mesa 23.2.1, zfs-utils 2.2.0, mkinitcpio 37

<big>Bug-fixes:</big>

- netinstall: Packages got renamed due the recent changes at the KF5 packaging
- netinstall: xdg-desktop-portal-gnome got added to the GNOME Installation
