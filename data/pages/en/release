<big>CachyOS 23.09</big>

This is our 10th release in 2023.
The release does change for systemd-boot the default encryption method to "luks2" and the netinstall got a clean up.
It is now possible to not install CachyOS related packages and they have now their own category.
We also got some major package upgrades, like llvm 16 and linux-cachyos 6.5.3.

Currently we are also testing a new method to provide the nvidia module. This method will replace "nvidia-dkms" and the module comes precompiled to avoid further compilations on the users machine.
This makes also sure, that the kernel does compile with the nvidia-driver.
We will do some further stability testing and then implement this into future releases.

Here's a summary of the changes:

<big>Features:</big>

- systemd-boot: Default to luks2
- netinstall: Provide a own category for CachyOS Packages
- Calamares synced with upstream
- Package updates: linux-cachyos 6.5.3, nvidia-utils 535.104.05, mesa 23.2.7

<big>Bug-fixes:</big>

- shellprocess_sdboot: Avoid using "sudo", when generating the boot entries at the installation process
