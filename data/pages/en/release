<big>CachyOS 23.03.1</big>

This is just a little fixing release.
There was currently a issue in the upstream calamares, which did bring netinstallation to fail, when the "lightdm" displaymanager was used.
Actually due a cleanup in the latest release of the offline installation, there was a issue with the keyring when the offline installation was used.

<big>Features:</big>

- Package updates: linux-cachyos 6.2.7, cachy-browser 111.0

<big>Bug-fixes:</big>

- Calamares got fixed with the lightdm displaymanager due faulty calamares upstream commits
- Offline installation keyring issue got fixed
- Refind: Use linux-cachyos-lts as defaullt. Current 6.2 seems not to work well together with refind
