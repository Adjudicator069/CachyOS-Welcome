<big>CachyOS 23.07</big>

This is our 7th release in 2023.
The release mainly brings some little features, like bpftune which automatically does adjust the network settings depending on the workload.
This means we don't need to provide manual network settings anymore, which may not suit to everyone's internet connection and network workload.
Array did bring a lot of updates to cachyos-qtile-settings, which rebased the top bar, rebased and new icons, Memory and total memory are now shown, reduced paddings and margins, workspace circles are smaller and the complete date is now shown.

Here's a summary of the changes:
