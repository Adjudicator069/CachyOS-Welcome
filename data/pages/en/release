<big>CachyOS 23.04</big>

This is our fourth release in 2023.
We are introducing now also "Qtile" as desktop enviroment at the netinstallation. Thanks to @array for maintaing the dotfiles.
There were also a bunch of fixes in the Hardware Detection. The upcomming releases will have a complete own "CachyOS Hardware Detection". We migrate Manjaro's Hardware Detection to a standalone CachyOS Tool, since mhwd is not well maintained and has a lot of issues in.

The next release will include then some major updates like python 3.11, llvm 16, gnome 44 and the 6.2 Kernel

<big>Features:</big>

- Introduce the Qtile desktop enviroment
- Reworked mhwd: Rust rewrite; Simplified profiles for GPUs and network cards; Removed bunch of ancient code
- Package updates: linux-cachyos 6.2.12, cachy-browser 112.0.1, mesa 23.0.3

<big>Bug-fixes:</big>

- f2fs: Remove "atgc" mount options since it has issues with systemd
