<big>CachyOS 22.05</big>

After about one year when CachyOS was founded we are really proud to announce our first GUI Installer Stable Release.
We investigated much work into the repo management, kernel development, infrastructure, theming, ... and finally also into the CachyOS GUI Installer.
We worked on many features to implement into the installer to give the user a completely customizable experience.

###  **Features:**

**Filesystems:**

- ext4
- xfs
- btrfs
- f2fs
- zfs

After we found a solution to provide all our custom kernels with the zfs module integrated we have implemented a direct out of a box install with zfs.
For the ZFS install are some minimal changes needed at the online install which can be found here:

**Desktop Environments:**

-     CuteFish – An Elegant, Beautiful and Easy-to-Use Linux Desktop
-     i3 tiling window manager, primarily targeted at developers and advanced users
-     KDE-Plasma Desktop - Simple by default, powerful when needed
-     GNOME Desktop - designed to put you in control and get things done
-     Openbox is a highly configurable, floating window manager with extensive standards support
-     Wayfire is a wayland compositor based on wlroots. It aims to create a customizable, extendable and lightweight environment without sacrificing its appearance
-     LXQT - The Lightweight Qt Desktop Environment.
-     bspwm is a tiling window manager that represents windows as the leaves of a full binary tree. bspwm supports multiple monitors and is configured and controlled through messages
-     Kofuku (bliss in Japanese) is a lightweight and minimalist Linux setup. This setup uses BSPWM as the tiling window manager.
-     Xfce is a lightweight desktop environment for UNIX-like operating systems. It aims to be fast and low on system resources, while still being visually appealing and user friendly

Also the installer has a auto detection which detects your cpu march and will use automatically the optimized repo's which are compiled if the optimized x86-64-v3 compiler flags, more you can find here:

**Linux Kernels:**

The CachyOS are improved kernels which improve the performance and other improvements. Following Scheduler are supported:

-     Standard Scheduler Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS) - linux-cachyos
-     CacULE and CacULE-RDB created from Hamad Marri, maintained by CachyOS - linux-cachyos-cacule
-     BitMap Queue (BMQ) Alfred Chen Scheduler - linux-cachyos-bmq
-     Priority and Deadline based Skiplist multiple queue scheduler (PDS) - Alfred Chen Scheduler » linux-cachyos-pds
-     Task Type Scheduler by Hamad Marri (TT) - linux-cachyos-tt
-     BORE (Burst-Oriented Response Enhancer) CPU Scheduler by firelzrd (BORE) - linux-cachyos-bore

All kernels are prebuilt in two different march versions (x86_64 and x86_64_v3) and also with the llvm/lto enabled kernels in the cachyos repo.

We are really happy to this release and looking forward into the future!
